This week, I used AI a lot for the most recent assignment, "Project 01: Function Library". Specifically, I was in charge of writing the README for this project, and I needed a refresher on how to write one, as well as how to format it in GitHub. Therefore, I asked ChatGPT 5 "How to format READ ME according to the directions given in the assignment" as well as "What do installation and setup instruction usually look like?". These are clarifying questions that was in need of answering in order to meet the requirements for the function library.
