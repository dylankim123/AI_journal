This week, I briefly used AI to explain the program that would allow me to turn values into dates for adding and subtracting days for the most recent coding homework. I feel in the future I will continue to use AI for explaining what certain fucntions do as I may not be familiar or need a reminder. On the other hand, I might take notes during lecture on an AI browser so that it can touch up on my notes in real time.
