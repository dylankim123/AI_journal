This week, I have not used AI for anything related to academics. I asked general questions regarding my hobbies such as movie recommendations and to build a playlist of songs similar to the genre of songs I already like. They were able to give good recommendations for both since my prompt included some examples for each. Moving forward, I will experiment with Claude AI since I have been hearing good reviews about it as well as seen it on advertisements a good amount of times.
