Week 1 journal
This week I used AI once. I used ChatGPT to explain the actions of each of the basic Python functions we were expected to use for Exercise set number 1. On top of this, I also had to use ChatGPT to learn how to create a txt file on GitHub. All of this is relatively new to me, so AI has been helping me get into the groove of things with this course.
