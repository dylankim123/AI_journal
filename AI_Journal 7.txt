This week, I used AI as a supportive tool to enhance my understanding and organization for Project 2. I asked it to clarify assignment instructions, generate study questions, and help format parts of my report more clearly. All AI-generated material was reviewed, edited, and supplemented with my own analysis to ensure that the final work reflected my original understanding and ideas, in full alignment with the UMD Honor Code.
