AI Journal 2
This week, I used AI once. I am testing out a new AI program called perplexity AI, and I used it to summarize my assignments for INST 326 that were due for tonight. Perplexity AI Pro is free for all students, so I would reccomend to others to try it out and I will include a link for it below. Other than that, my AI usage was very low.
